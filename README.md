# mash_game


A python CLI game based on the classic middle school fortune telling game.  
In the original game one person writes MASH (an acronym for mansion, apartment, 
shack, house) at the top of a page. Then several categories, such as number of kids,  
career, etc are populated with different options, typically with one or two duds in the mix.
A spiral is drawn and the number of rings determines a random number.
The player then goes through the all of the mini lists, including MASH as if 
it were one large list crossing out every nth item until there is only one
item left in each list. Thus the player fortune is determined.

In this version a player fills out a survey. Some answers directly populate a list in
category and other answers populate the list with a prewritten selection, keeping playability high.
After the survery is complete a fortune is returned to the console.
